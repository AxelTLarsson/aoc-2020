# Advent of Code 2020

My ambition is to solve all puzzles in Haskell, while, incrementally, building up my toolchain around it and brushing up on my Haskell skillz.

## Running

- Install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) (I may change this in the future, Cabal seems more light weight?)
- `stack run`
